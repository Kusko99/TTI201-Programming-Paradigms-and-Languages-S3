# Programming Paradigms Repository

Welcome! This repository contains the codes developed during the "Programming Paradigms" course at Mau√° Institute, instructed by Professor Igor Caetano. The codes are implemented in the functional paradigm using Scheme and the logic paradigm using Prolog.

## About the Course

This repository showcases codes developed as part of the "Programming Paradigms" course, where Professor Igor Caetano introduced students to both the functional paradigm using Scheme and the logic paradigm using Prolog.

## Contents

- **Functional (Scheme):** Codes implemented in the functional paradigm using Scheme.
- **Logic (Prolog):** Codes developed in the logic paradigm using Prolog.

## How to Use This Repository

Explore the codebase to understand and learn from implementations in both the functional and logic paradigms. The codes serve as practical examples to reinforce the concepts covered in the course.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on any of the course materials.

Enjoy your exploration of Programming Paradigms!
